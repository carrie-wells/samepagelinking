  <h2 id="introduction" class="anchor">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Having a Christmas tree in your home during the holidays has become a common tradition, but how did it all begin? In the past, plants and trees that stayed green all year had a special meaning for people in the winter. Just as people today decorate their homes with evergreen trees, ancient people hung evergreen boughs over their doors and windows. We have evidence of this tradition in ancient Roman, Egyptian, Celtic, and Viking cultures. Often it was believed that evergreens would keep away evil.

  <p>The Christmas tree tradition as we know it today was started in Germany during the 1500s. Christians would build wood pyramids decorated with evergreen branches and lit candles. </p>

  <p>Most Americans thought Christmas trees were odd during the 1800s.  The first record of one being on display was in the 1830s by the German settlers of Pennsylvania, although trees had been a tradition in many German homes much earlier. Many American Christians were Puritans, and they viewed any extra celebrations, like having a tree or singing carols, as against their beliefs. However, by the 1890s, Christmas ornaments were arriving from Germany and Christmas trees were more popular around the U.S. Europeans used small trees about four feet in height, while Americans liked their Christmas trees to reach the ceiling. Americans also liked homemade ornaments, while Germans continued to use traditional ornaments, like apples and nuts. In time, electricity brought the addition of Christmas lights on trees.
